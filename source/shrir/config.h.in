/**
* @mainpage Smart High Resolution Image Reconstruction.
* @section intro Introduction.
* This project gives a framework to find the best parameters
* for the HRIR Project. 
*
* As it is described in the HRIR project to find the best parameters
* are difficult. In order to find this in this project an evolution
* algorithm is used.
*
* The input of the algorithm is only few parameters, the basic population
* and the mutations are given. The rank of the algorithm is the 
* Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (psnr). The input of it the raw data of an
* black and with image, and the result is a twice  bigger image which 
* is created by the best parameter which is found.
