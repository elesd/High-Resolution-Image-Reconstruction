This project contains an abstract implementation of Evolution algorithm. It is an iteration based algorithm. In this implementation is based on states. One state describe one evolution iteration. It basically contains the population the mutatins, and the rank calculation function pointer. Via this function pointer one can adapt this algorithm.\hypertarget{index_basic_things}{}\subsection{Basic Statements}\label{index_basic_things}
This library contains a list and a priority list. This containers always do a whole copy from the given object with specific function pointers. Due to this one has to always gaurantee the correct function usage to avoid memory leaks.
