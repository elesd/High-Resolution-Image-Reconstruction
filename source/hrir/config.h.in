/**
* @mainpage High Resolution Image Reconstruction
* @section intro Introduction
* With Haar Transformation this project implements a high
* resolution image reconstructino framework.
* @section more_details More Details.
* Usually the input of the reconstruction is a small image, the
* result is a twice more bigger image. It only works for black and
* weith images, and the quality of a simple transformation not so high.
* To improve this there are different kind of pre-process possibilities,
* with different kind of filters and edge detection. It is because the
* haar transformation is based on edges, so to improve the quality of
* edges can improve the reconstruction quality. Unfortunately it is
* hard to determine which parameter settings are the best.
